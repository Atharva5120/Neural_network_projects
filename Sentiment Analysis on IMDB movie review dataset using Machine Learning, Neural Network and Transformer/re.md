The objective of the study is to take a deep dive into the methodologies and techniques of
predicting the sentiment of the text that is sentiment analysis. Training large amount of data
1.4 Significance of the Study 9
to predict the sentiment of the text in our dataset. We have choose to work on IMDB movieâ€™s
review dataset. Additionally we will also use Natural language processing (NLP) for data
prepossessing like removing stop-words, lemmatization etc. We will also discover some
applications and techniques such as standard machine learning algorithms, neural network
and deep learning based transformer approach to identify the sentiment in different types of
text. Thereafter, we will compare the results of standard machine learning algorithms, neural
networks and BERT transformer.
